# Applied machine-learning for science

ðŸ’» Material for a course on applied machine-learning for scientists taught at
EPFL in Spring 2017.

ðŸš§ This is still under heavy construction ðŸš§

# Outline

The course consists of six two hour lectures, followed by one hour to discuss
the weeks homework assignment.

Current bucket list of topics to cover ((~) denotes: short introduction to):

1. General problem statement and introduction
2. Ensembles of trees: forests and gradient boosting
3. Neural networks: convolutions aren't convoluted
4. Model selection and evaluation: predict future performance
5. PCA and t-SNE: lower dimensional embeddings and visualisation
5. Bayesian optimisation for hyper-parameter tuning (~)
6. Meet a GAN: cops and robbers for neural networks (~)
7. Fine tuning state the state of the art: standing on the shoulder of giants (~)
8. Probabilistic datastructures: a bonus lecture


# Technicalities, installing, running code

All the code will be written in python. We will make use of the scientific
python stack:

* python v3.6
* numpy v1.12.1
* scikit-learn v0.18.1
* keras
* matplotlib v2.0.0
* jupyter v5.0.0

All work submitted for credit has to run with those dependencies only.
